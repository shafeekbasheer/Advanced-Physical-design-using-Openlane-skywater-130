# Advanced-Physical-design-using-Openlane-skywater-130
This project is done in the course "Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130" by VLSI System Design Corporation. In this project a complete RTL to GDSII flow for PicoRV32a SoC is executed with Openlane using Skywater130nm PDK. Custom designed standard cells with Sky130 PDK are also used in the flow.
